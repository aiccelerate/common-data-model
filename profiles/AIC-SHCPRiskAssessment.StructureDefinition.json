  "purpose": "This profile is a part of the common data model designed in AICCELERATE project (https://aiccelerate.eu/) and one of the base profiles that is commonly used in all three pilots; i) Pilot 1- Patient flow management for Emergency Room and Surgical units., ii) Pilot 2 - Chronic adult care – Parkinson’s disease, iii)  Palliative and chronic pediatric service delivery and patient workflow",
